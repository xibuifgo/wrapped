    "Nour": "You are a walking contradiction in the funniest way possible. You stood all alone on Team Jeremiah, proudly defending your boy while everyone else either went Conrad-crazy or said Belly should stay single. That's classic you: rooting for the underdog, even when the whole world disagrees. Your comfort movie is Shrek, which explains a lotâ€”you thrive on chaotic humor, unexpected wholesomeness, and quoting Donkey unironically. You said Earthbender in ATLA, which makes sense because you are stubborn to your core. Once you decide you're right, nothing can move you. \n\nFood-wise, you couldn't stop at one potatoâ€”you picked mashed, crisps, wedges, AND chips. You don't want a preference; you want the full menu. Same with Spider-Man: Tobey, Andrew, AND Tom. Commitment? Never heard of it. Jewelry? That was the one place you drew the line, saying none at allâ€”proving that you're antisocial about sparkle but overcommitted to carbs. \n\nIn adventures, you clicked hiking, theme parks, AND camping. You basically want a survival reality show with churros. Your rainforest pick was Canopy, of course, because you want to be high enough to see everything while still being part of the drama. And in the sticker poll, you picked number 6â€”the cat with the propeller hat and lollipopâ€”which sums you up perfectly: playful, unserious, childlike chaos bundled into a single image. \n\nYou are carbs, chaos, and Shrek energy. The group wouldn't be the same without your mix of stubborn loyalty, over-the-top choices, and your ability to turn every poll into a personality trait.",

    "Anica": "You are the dependable friend with a flair for the dramatic. You voted Princess Diaries as your comfort movie because you secretly believe you're one accidental makeover away from discovering you're royalty. You live for Instagram Reels, not because you're shallow, but because you see them as tiny bursts of serotonin to carry you through the day. In bending, you said Water, which makes sense: you like to look calm and mysterious, but really you're as chaotic as the tide during a storm. \n\nYou picked wedges for potatoes, because you need your snacks bold, crunchy, and dramaticâ€”just like you. You voted for Tom Holland as Spider-Man, because you like a mix of sweet and awkward with a touch of heartthrob. Jewelry? You go with earrings and braceletsâ€”enough to sparkle, not enough to weigh you down. Your rainforest choice was Canopy, which makes senseâ€”you want to be above the crowd while still staying approachable. \n\nOn adventures, you picked hiking and camping. You're the friend who drags everyone to the top of a hill, forces them into group selfies, and insists it was worth the sweat. And when it came to the sticker poll, you chose number 4â€”the cursed falcon faceâ€”which is peak your energy. It's weird, unsettling, and somehow hilarious. You'd absolutely send that in the group chat just to make everyone uncomfortable. \n\nYou're dramatic but dependable, funny but aesthetic, and the one who ensures every outing is documented. Without you, the group would have no proof the chaos even happened.",

    "Aliyah": "You are the lovable menace. You proudly voted Team Conrad and acted shocked when people said it was toxic. You know exactly what you're doingâ€”you enjoy stirring the pot and then watching it bubble. TikTok owns your life, but you pretend you're just 'keeping up with trends.' Potatoes? Wedges, obviously, because you need a snack that screams main character. Your comfort movies are chaotic but fun, and you'd never admit you cried at Princess Diaries. \n\nIn bending, you picked Water. You like to think it's because you're mysterious, but really it's because you want to spend summers at the beach. Spider-Man? You went Andrew and Shameik, because you like a little edge mixed with style. Jewelry? Earrings, because you need just enough sparkle to grab attention when you walk into a room. Your rainforest choice was Forest Floor, which you thought sounded mysterious, but really it's giving goblin-core. \n\nFor adventures, you said theme parks. That checks outâ€”you're the one screaming the loudest on rides and then demanding everyone buy overpriced snacks. And in the sticker poll, you picked number 3â€”the wide-eyed catâ€”which perfectly matches your 'caught in 4K' energy. You live for drama, play the main character, and thrive in chaos. You're equal parts bestie and villain, and everyone knows it.",

    "Bilgesu": "You are the group\u2019s reluctant chaos gremlin. On the surface, you act like you don\u2019t care \u2014 polls are 'dumb,' matcha tastes like grass, and you\u2019d rather stay home than hike. But then the receipts show up: you *did* click hiking, you *did* click anime, and you even picked the shy uwu bear with \ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udc48 hands. That\u2019s the real you peeking through \u2014 soft, awkward, pretending not to care while secretly caring too much.\n\nYou\u2019re the friend who signs up for camping and immediately regrets it, muttering about bugs while cocooned in three blankets. Hiking? You\u2019ll complain halfway, but somehow you\u2019re still there, trailing behind the group, offering sarcastic commentary about everyone\u2019s shoes. Potatoes? You couldn\u2019t be bothered to pick \u2014 which is classic you: let others fight, then eat whatever wins. Jewelry? Also a no. Everyone else is out here jingling with jhumkas, and you\u2019re just\u2026 unbothered.\n\nBut the uwu bear exposes you. You could have gone full chaos with literally anything else, but no \u2014 you chose the bashful one, the emoji-hands one. Deep down, you\u2019re not the detached icon you pretend to be. You\u2019re secretly sentimental, a little shy, maybe even soft. You\u2019ll roast people for watching *Princess Diaries*, then rewatch it alone. You\u2019ll say camping is torture, but you\u2019ll still show up with snacks.\n\nYour role in the group is chaos commentary: always hovering between 'I\u2019m over this' and 'fine, I\u2019ll join.' You bring mystery because no one can tell if you\u2019re joking or dead serious. That unpredictability \u2014 blunt sarcasm hiding uwu softness \u2014 makes you iconic.\n\nYou\u2019re the bear with shy hands, Bilgesu: claws on the outside, squish on the inside.",
    
    "Khadeja": "You are the quiet schemer of the group, the one who voted both Team Conrad and Team Stay Away just to keep everyone guessing. You thrive on creating drama without being in the middle of itâ€”classic puppet-master energy. Your comfort movie picks lean toward Princess Diaries, because you want the glow-up montage life, but then you're also the one who called matcha 'tastes like grass' with your full chest. You'd still order it for the aesthetic pic though. \n\nJewelry? You went wild. Earrings, dangly things, nose-to-ear chainsâ€”you're basically Bedazzled the person. Rainforest? Canopy, because you want to be seen as mysterious and elevated but still shady enough to stir trouble from above. You live on Reels, obviously, and you'd happily judge anyone who says TikTok is better. Potatoes? You like mashedâ€”classic comfort food, but also a solid foundation to fuel your scheming. \n\nAdventure-wise, you chose hiking but you're definitely the one who complains halfway through, while secretly loving the chaos. And in the sticker poll, you picked number 4â€”the cursed falcon face. That's so you: unsettling, funny, and just a bit shady. You're the friend who stirs the pot, then claims innocence, and somehow everyone still trusts you. You're glitter and shade rolled into one.",

    "Madiha": "You are chaotic sparkle energy bottled up into a bestie. You couldn't just pick one comfort movieâ€”you wanted Princess Diaries, Confessions of a Shopaholic, AND probably Shrek too. You treat polls like buffets: why pick one potato when you can have mashed, wedges, and crisps? Spider-Man? You went Andrew Garfield and Tom Holland, because commitment is not in your vocabulary. You thrive on over-choiceâ€”it's your natural habitat. \n\nYou live on Instagram Reels, spamming the group chat at 3am with the caption 'this is so us' when it clearly isn't. Bending? Firebender, because you know you're dramatic, and you lean into it. Jewelry? You checked off basically every optionâ€”jhumkas, anklets, dangly thingsâ€”you're a walking jewelry store and you like the noise. Rainforest? Canopy, because obviously you want to be on top of the chaos tree. \n\nAdventures? Hiking, camping, theme parksâ€”you want all three, even if you'll complain halfway through. But the real gem? In the sticker poll, you picked number 2â€”the shy uwu bear with ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘ˆ. That says everything: you present big, loud, and dramatic, but deep down you're soft and sentimental. You're chaotic glitter on the outside, uwu energy on the inside. \n\nYou're basically the group's human rom-comâ€”over-the-top, dramatic, hilarious, but also a little mushy at heart. You love chaos, but you also love pretending you're shy about it. You're the star of the show, whether you admit it or not.",

    "Rameen": "You are unpredictable energy bottled up into a bestie. You picked Firebender, which is perfectâ€”you are literally chaotic flame vibes. Your comfort movie? Shrek, which tracks because you thrive on unhinged humor. Potatoes? Crisps, wedges, chipsâ€”you want snacks you can eat in bed while spiraling down a YouTube conspiracy rabbit hole. You said nose rings are cool, which tells me you've definitely thought about piercing something impulsively at 2am. \n\nTheme parks? Of course, but you probably scream louder than the kids on the roller coasters. Jewelry? Edgy and dramaticâ€”you're not here for subtlety. Rainforest? You probably didn't care enough to pick seriously, because you'd rather be laughing at everyone else's choices. Spider-Man? You didn't settle eitherâ€”you like them all, because you want drama and style. \n\nAnd in the sticker poll, you picked number 1â€”the cowboy meme. That's absolutely you: unpredictable, dramatic, and somehow hilarious in every situation. You're the friend who walks into chaos like it's a saloon and declares, 'You've yee'd your last haw.'",

    "Safaa": "You are aesthetic drama wrapped in vibes. You're the only one who proudly said Airbender, which makes you the mysterious loner of the group. Your potato choice? Mashed, because you're classy like that. Comfort movies? Princess Diaries, of courseâ€”you're living for elegance. But then you voted Instagram Reels as your short-form content, because you want chaotic vibes in ten-second doses. Jewelry? Earrings and jhumkasâ€”you basically want your ears to look like chandeliers. \n\nYour rainforest choice was Emergent Layer, which screams 'I want to rise above everyone else, but make it aesthetic.' Adventures? Theme parks and hikingâ€”you'll do both, but only if you can take aesthetic Polaroids. Spider-Man? You said Andrew Garfield, because you like the romantic, edgy one. \n\nAnd in the sticker poll, you picked number 5â€”the round cat with the pink bow. That's you: soft, aesthetic, a little dramatic, and oddly comforting. You're Pinterest-board chaos: dramatic in style, curated in behavior, and secretly addicted to vibes.",

    "Salma": "You are dramatic queen bee energy. You proudly voted Team Conrad and lived for the chaos it created. Comfort movies? Confessions of a Shopaholic and Princess Diariesâ€”you want drama, fashion, and chaos all rolled into one. Potatoes? Crisps, wedges, chipsâ€”you love a carb feast. Spider-Man? You went with Tom Holland, because you like a heartthrob with awkward energy. \n\nInstagram Reels owns your screen time, don't even deny it. Jewelry? Earrings, because you know sparkle is your birthright. Rainforest? Canopy, naturallyâ€”you belong at the top, surveying your subjects. Adventures? Beach and theme parksâ€”you like glam with fun. You're the friend who insists on churros at Disneyland and poses like it's Vogue. \n\nAnd in the sticker poll, you picked number 5â€”the bow-cat. That's your vibe: dramatic, cute, a little extra, but always noticed. You're equal parts diva and chaos gremlin, and the group wouldn't survive without your energy.",

    "Samiya": "You are the undercover menace. You voted Team Conrad AND Team Stay Away, just to confuse people. Comfort movie? Shrek, because you're chaotic but soft. Potatoes? Wedges, because you're the star of your own show. TikTok? Of course, you probably spam everyone with videos until they mute you. Bending? Water, because you want to seem soft, but really you'd fight someone over the last fry. \n\nJewelry? Earrings, because sparkle is essential. Rainforest? Forest Floor, because you know you belong with the goblins. Adventures? Theme parks, hikingâ€”you're there for the chaos, not the nature. Spider-Man? You love Andrew Garfield AND Shameik Moore, because you thrive on edgy drama. \n\nAnd in the sticker poll, you picked number 1â€”the cowboy. That's your whole energy: loud, chaotic, and ready to stir drama. You're half bestie, half villain, always loveable but occasionally terrifying. The group chat wouldn't survive without your menace energy.",

    "Suweda": "You are chaos personified, but in the most endearing way. Comfort movies? Shrek, Princess Diaries, Confessionsâ€”you picked them all. Potatoes? Wedges, crisps, chipsâ€”you basically built a carb buffet. Spider-Man? Shameik, Tomâ€”you refuse to choose one. Jewelry? Necklaces, bracelets, jhumkasâ€”you want to jingle when you walk into a room. Bending? Earth, which is ironic since you probably hate dirt. \n\nAdventures? Hiking, camping, theme parksâ€”you said yes to everything. You want to do it all, even if you're complaining the whole way. Rainforest? You went with Undergrowth, which is pure gremlin-coreâ€”lurking at the bottom, causing chaos for the people above. Instagram Reels is your weaknessâ€”you scroll until 4am, then wake up confused why you're tired. \n\nAnd in the sticker poll, you picked number 2â€”the shy uwu bear with ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘ˆ. That's exactly you: you walk into a room giving big chaotic bear energy, but inside you're soft and awkward. You pretend you're tough, but you're secretly sentimental. That sticker sums you up perfectlyâ€”you're loud, dramatic, but with a soft underbelly that you only show the people you trust. \n\nYou are the group's lovable gremlin: unpredictable, messy, and hilarious, but also capable of shocking sweetness when no one expects it. You're the bear with uwu handsâ€”chaos on the outside, squish on the inside.",

    "Zainab": "You are emo chaos. You voted Team Conrad but secretly wanted Jeremiah to win, because you live for pain. Comfort movie? Princess Diaries, because you're secretly romantic. Potatoes? Mashed, wedges, crispsâ€”you clicked everything, because carbs are therapy. Jewelry? Earrings and jhumkasâ€”you're basically running an Etsy store. Matcha? You said it tastes like grass, but you'd still drink it if someone bought it. \n\nRainforest? Forest Floorâ€”classic goblin-core. Adventures? Beach and hikingâ€”you like nature but only if it looks like an indie film scene. Spider-Man? Andrew Garfield, because you love tortured souls. \n\nAnd in the sticker poll, you picked number 6â€”the silly cat with the propeller hat and lollipop. That's your vibe: emo but funny, moody but chaotic. You're cottage-core meets chaos gremlin, roasting everyone while secretly caring the most. You're the group's moody comedian, and without you, things would be way too normal.",

    "Aiza": "You are the princess-gremlin hybrid. Comfort movie? Princess Diaries, obviouslyâ€”you're waiting for your tiara moment. Potatoes? Wedges, because you want your carbs bold and dramatic. Jewelry? Earrings, jhumkas, braceletsâ€”you're basically jingling with sparkle. Rainforest? Forest Floor, which is giving mysterious goblin but with accessories. \n\nInstagram Reels owns youâ€”you're always scrolling, laughing at the weirdest clips, and then forcing your friends to watch. Spider-Man? You voted Tobey, Andrew, AND Tom, which is not taste, it's indecision in disguise. Bending? Water, because you want to look graceful, but really you're just splashing chaos. \n\nAdventures? Camping and hikingâ€”you're the one who drags people outside, then complains about bugs. Comfort vibes? Totally aesthetic, but also secretly messy. \n\nAnd in the sticker poll, you picked number 6â€”the cat with the propeller hat and lollipop. That's your vibe: childish chaos with sparkles. You're dramatic, sparkly, indecisive, and adorableâ€”the princess-goblin that makes everything fun."
